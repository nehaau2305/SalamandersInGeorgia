Frosted Flatwoods Salamander
(Ambystoma cingulatum)

Description
The Frosted Flatwood salamander is a small salamander ranging from 9 to 13.5
 cm total and are identified by their dark gray or black color on their dorsum
  and light gray or grayish brown markings that form reticulations, a frosted
  lichenlike pattern, or small annuli. This species of mole salamander has a
  small, indistinct head, short legs, & a long rounded tail.

Habitat
The salamanders originate from southeastern coastal part of the United States.
They breed in shallow, ephemeral (temporary & isolated) ponds.
This longleaf pine ecosystem offers them a variety of small invertebrates and
 earthworms to feed on. Since the ponds usually dry up by summertime, the
 adults typically migrate from surrounding upland habitats to their natal
 wetlands from September through December. Since this species is less studied,
 a lot is unknown about the habits of this species.

Endangered
The Frosted Flatwood salamander is an endangered species due to habitat loss.
Less than 3% of the longleaf pine cover remains. Usually, these forests are
burned during the summer, which would not impact the salamanders' winter
routine. However, humans have switched to burning in the winter allowing
shrubs to crowd out the necessary plants and soak up all the water. The
salamanders depend on the small depressions of water for their eggs to hatch.
