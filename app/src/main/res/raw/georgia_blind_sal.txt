Georgia Blind Salamander
(Haideotriton wallacei)
The Georgia Blind Salamander only ever reaches 5.1 to 7.6 cm in adulthood making it a relatively small salamander. They have no extrinsic eye muscles with underdeveloped retinas that lack rods & cones. The eyes itself are very small and are covered by fat. Little pigment exists in their body making them pinkish white & somewhat iridescent. They are lungless & breathe through their long, red external gills.
Underground caves & springs in southwest Georgia & adjacent Florida are the only known habitats of the Georgia Blind salamander. It is rarely seen above ground & as such, is hard to study. However, it is known that all the known locations of the salamander are connected to the Floridan aquifer, a vast system of underground water-filled passageways. This suggests that the various populations are actually linked. This region provides them with ostracods, amphipods, isopods, copepods and other small aquatic prey to feed on.
The endemic nature (being confined to 1 small region) of this species poses a threat. The International Union for Conservation of Nature considers this salamander to be vulnerable as a result. Threats to its habitat includes water pollution, water level changes, & human collection. Certain agricultural activities introduce pollution to the water & extraction of the water from aquifers reduces water levels in their caves.
