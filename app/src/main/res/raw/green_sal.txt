Green Salamander
(Aneides aeneus)
The Green Salamander is a lungless species that breathes through a process called cutaneous respiration allowing the salamander to breathe through its skin. This species is small with the full adult size ranging from 8 to 12 cm. Their body is flattened and elongated with a dark background & bronze or copper spots all over.
Both the Allegheny Mountain Range and the Cumberland Plateau house the green salamander. They are also found in South-Central Ohio and in isolated populations in the Blue Ridge Mountains in Georgia, North Carolina, & South Carolina. Within these areas, the green salamander inhabits rock crevices, the sides of cliffs, or other outcroppings. They require a little to no sunlight which fosters a moist environment. The male green salamanders are incredibly territorial and exhibit aggressive behavior towards intruder salamanders & predators. The female green salamanders only exhibit this behavior to protect their breeding crevices.
Indiana lists the green salamander as endangered while Georgia & North Carolina list them as "imperiled" and South Carolina lists them as "critically imperiled". It's habitat specificity poses a threat, although the cliffs & outcroppings itself are relatively safe. However, the green salamander mature slowly, with some sources citing 3 years & others citing 7 to 8 years. So, if the species faces overcollection, disease, habitat loss, or climate change, the green salamander will not be able to repopulate easily with reduced adult populations & delayed reproductive maturity. Recovery efforts would be slow & uncertain.
