Patch-nosed Salamander
(Urspelerpes brucei)
The Patch-Nosed Salamander only ever reaches 5cm in total length making it one of the smallest species of salamander in the world. They are lungless and breathe through external brownish gills. Adult salamanders have a narrow yellow line along the top of the tail, a bright yellow belly, and a light yellow patch on the snout. This species's coloration & pattern are sexually dimorphic. Females are brownish-yellow overall while the males are more decorated. They are more yellow & have 2 dark stripes running down their back. Males also have spiny premaxillary teeth that are longer than those of females.
The patch-nosed salamander is distributed only in sites in northeastern Georgia & northwestern South Carolina, making them endemic. They are found in leaf litter within areas of high canopy closure (highly shaded areas). This keeps their environment cool and moist. Larvae for this species have been known to be located in submerged leaf packs. This area, as well as the salamander's jaw, teeth, & tongue, suggest that the patch-nosed salamander feeds on small terrestrial invertebrates.
Having only been discovered in 2007, this highly secretive salamander's conservation status is quite unclear. The patch-nosed salamander is likely threatened by climate change that could destroy its moist environment. Water population would also disrupt the aquatic system it inhabits. Being endemic to a specific region also poses a significant threat, as population recovery would be difficult if anything were to negatively impact their limited habitat.
