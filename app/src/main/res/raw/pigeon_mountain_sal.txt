Pigeon Mountain Salamander
(Plethodon petraeus)
The Pigeon Mountain salamander is a larger species with adults reaching 18 cm on average. The salamander are reddish brown with only the underside of the belly and tail being black. White & brass colored spots line the abdomen, tail, and limbs. Their feet are webbed, flattened, & broad to allow them to cling to walls while their eyes are bulbous & forward facing.
This species is an endemic species meaning its only found in 1 geographic location which is Pigeon Mountain, hence the name. Pigeon Mountain is located in the northwestern region of Georgia. Within this area, the salamanders occupy caves & rocky outcrops. This region provides them with beetles, ant, and many other invertebrates.
Though the species is abundant within Pigeon Mountain, its endemic nature poses a threat. Climate change causes higher elevations to become warm & lose its moisture. The Pigeon Mountain salamander depends on the moisture and may lose its habitat, raising the potential for extinction of this species. Thus, although this species is not endangered, the Georgia Department of Natural Resources named the Pigeon Mountain salamander as a rare & protected species. The International Union for Conservation of Nature Red List also names this species as an "At-Risk" species.
