Reticulated Flatwoods Salamander
(Ambystoma bishopi)

Description
The reticulated flatwoods salamander is a species of mole salamander. This
salamander species is medium-sized with a length of 4 to 5 cm. They have a
tapered snout with vomerine teeth used for grabbing their prey. The skin of
the salamander is smooth and the dorsal surface is reticulated with thin
grey lines constructing a net-like pattern upon the salamander's brownish-
black skin.

Habitat
Every species that falls under the family Ambystomatidae is a mole
salamander, meaning that the adults spend most of their lives underground
in burrows. The reticulated flatwood salamander live among the leaf litter
beneath longleaf pine and wiregrass in the flatwoods coastal plain ecosystems
in southwestern Georgia and Florida. This habitat allows them to lay their eggs
in small depressions under the leaf litter. After metamorphosis in the
spring, mature salamanders migrate to higher areas away from water and return
in the fall to breed.

Endangered
The reticulated flatwoods salamander is endangered with many historic
populations already being destroyed due to habitat loss or degradation. Its
habitat allows growing-season fires, either natural or prescribed. These fires
burn through their breeding sites.
