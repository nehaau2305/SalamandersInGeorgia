Reticulated Flatwoods Salamander
(Ambystoma bishopi)
The Reticulated Flatwoods salamander is a species of mole salamander. This salamander species is medium-sized with a length of 4 to 5 cm. They have a tapered snout with vomerine teeth used for grabbing their prey. The skin of the salamander is smooth and the dorsal surface is reticulated with thin grey lines constructing a net-like pattern upon the salamander's brownish-black skin.
Every species that falls under the family Ambystomatidae is a mole salamander, meaning that the adults spend most of their lives underground in burrows. The Reticulated Flatwood salamander live among the leaf litter beneath longleaf pine and wiregrass in the flatwoods coastal plain ecosystems in southwestern Georgia and Florida. This habitat allows them to lay their eggs in small depressions under the leaf litter. After metamorphosis in the spring, mature salamanders migrate to higher areas away from water and return in the fall to breed.
The Reticulated Flatwoods salamander is endangered with many historic populations already being destroyed due to habitat loss or degradation. Its habitat allows growing-season fires, either natural or prescribed. These fires burn through their breeding sites.
