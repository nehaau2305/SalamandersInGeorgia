Tennessee Cave Salamander
(Gyrinophilus palleucus)
The Tennessee Cave Salamander is large, reaching 10 to 19 cm in length in adulthood. They have small but functioning eyes, lack eyelids, a wide head, & a spatulate snout. Since they belong to the Plethodontidae family, they are lungless just like all other spcies within the family. As such, the Tennessee Cave salamander breathes through their bright red & feathery external gills. The rest of the body is pigmented with a salmon to pale pink & pale belly.
The species inhabits the southern Cumberland Plateau in the Appalachian Mountains. More specifically, it ranges from south-central Tennessee, western North Carolina, northeastern & northwestern Alabama, & finally northwestern Georgia. The salamander occupies cave systems that provide them with a diet of amphipods and other small aquatic invertebrates. Since their habitat is inaccessible, the habits of this species is unknown.
The Tennessee Cave salamander is dependent on the water quality of the caves' streams. Due to pollution, siltation, flooding, increased water flow, the filling of sinkholes, & its endemic nature (being confined to one small region), the International Union for Conservation of Nature has declared the species to be "threatened". Protection of the watersheds that drain into the caverns in which it lives would help mitigate the threats.
